Installing the software
***********************

Hardware requirements
=====================

Stuff runs in (ANSI) text-mode from a shell. A window system is
not necessary for basic operation.

Memory usage is very small (a few tens of Megabytes), even when generating
very large catalogs.

Obtaining Stuff
===============

For Linux users, the simplest way to have Stuff up and running is
to install the standard binary package the comes with your Linux
distribution. Run, e.g., "apt-get Stuff" (on Debian) or "dnf install Stuff"
(Fedora) and Stuff, as well as all its dependencies, will
automatically be installed. If you decided to install the package this
way you may skip the following and move straight to the next section.

However if Stuff is not available in your distribution, or to
obtain the most recent version, the Stuff source package can be
downloaded from the official GitHub repository . One may choose one of
the stable releases, or for the fearless, a copy of the current master
development branch.


Software requirements
=====================

Stuff has been developed on GNU/Linux machines and should compile
on any POSIX-compliant system (this includes Apple OS X and Cygwin
on Microsoft Windows, at the price of some difficulties with the
configuration). No external libraries are required.

Installation
============

To install from the GitHub source package, you must first uncompress
the archive:

   $ unzip stuff-<version>.zip

A new directory called "stuff-<version>" should now appear at the
current location on your disk. Enter the directory and generate the
files required by the autotools, which the package relies on:

   $ cd stuff-<version>
   $ sh autogen.sh

A "configure" script is created. This script has many options, which
may be listed with the "--help" option:

   $ ./configure --help

No options are required for compiling with the default GNU C compiler
("gcc") if all the required libraries are installed at their default
locations:

   $ ./configure

Compared to "gcc", the Intel compiler ("icc") can give the Stuff executable
a strong boost in performance, thanks to better vectorized code. If "icc" is
installed on your system [1], you can take advantage of it using instead

   $ ./configure --enable-icc

Additionally, if the Stuff binary is to be run on a different
machine that does not have "icc" installed (e.g., a cluster computing node),
you must configure a partially statically linked executable using

   $ ./configure --enable-icc --enable-auto-flags --enable-best-link

In all cases, Stuff can now be compiled with

   $ make -j

An "src/stuff" executable is created. For system-wide installation,
run the usual

   $ sudo make install

You may now check that the software is properly installed by simply
typing in your shell:

   $ stuff

(note that some shells require the "rehash" command to be run before
making a freshly installed executable accessible in the execution
path).

[1] The Linux versions of the Intel compiler is  available for free
    to academic researchers, students, educators and open source contributors.
