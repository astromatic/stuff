November 26, 2001: V1.10
	- Added magnitude zero-point and sky brightness computations

October 15, 1999: V1.05
	- Added display of relative zero-points.
	- Ultra-faint galaxy size bug fixed.

October 11, 1999: V1.04
	- New DATA_DIRECTORY string parameter that specifies a particular
	  directory for Stuff data (SEDs, filters, etc.).
	- Image and pixel sizes can now be different for each passband.

September 27, 1999: V1.03
	- Changed output format (added separate bulge position angle).
	- Bulge q>1 bug fixed.

July 2, 1999: V1.02
	- Filtering of galaxies brighter than MAG_LIMITS(0) now applies.

May 23, 1999: V1.01
	- floating exception on DEC Alphas fixed.
	- PICKLES stellar SED library added (thanks to S. Arnouts).

November 5, 1998: V1.0
	- First experimental release.
	- Implementation is still incomplete:
	  - no galactic objects yet,
	  - no galactic (Milky Way) extinction,
	  - galaxy-galaxy correlations missing,
	  - no gravitational lensing,
	  - no galaxy evolution.
