Stuff is a program that generates artificial but realistic
catalogs of astronomical sources. These catalogs can be loaded
in SkyMaker to generate image simulations.

This file describes shortly the syntax of Stuff.
See INSTALL for instructions about install.
For more information, please refer to the documentation
(see http://astromatic.iap.fr/software/stuff/ )

The general syntax is similar to that of SkyMaker:

% stuff [-c <Configuration_file>] [-<keyword> <value>] ...

- Keyword parameters given in the command line override those from the
  configuration file.
- By default Stuff looks for a default configuration file called ``stuff.conf''
  in the current directory. If no configuration file is available, Stuff uses
  internal defaults.

% stuff -d

prints a default configuration file on the standard output

Please report any bug or strange behaviour to bertin@iap.fr.
