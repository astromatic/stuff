This sub-directory contains ".sed" files describing spectral energy
distributions of selected astronomical objects and photometric system
reference spectra.
- In each file there is one line per data-point. The first column
  is the wavelength, in Angstroems. The second column contains the
  f_lambda flux-density, in arbitrary units (all spectra get recalibrated).
- Comment lines must begin with `#'.
- If wavelengths are negative, flux-densities are read as f_nu.
- Wavelengths must be sorted by increasing lambda.
- Spectra are linearly interpolated between data-points by SkyStuff,
  in their native units (f_nu or f_lambda).
- Each spectrum must begin and end with f_lambda or f_nu equal to 0.
